The basic functionalities provided by the task scheduler API are as follows:
• Specifying the maximum number of concurrently executing tasks
• Adding a task to the scheduler queue, with or without starting
• Scheduling tasks while already scheduled tasks are being executed
• Initiating, pausing, resuming, and stopping a task
• Waiting for the completion of task execution
• Specifying the scheduling algorithm, including FIFO (FCFS) and priority-based scheduling
